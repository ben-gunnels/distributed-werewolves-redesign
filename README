Virtual Werewolf Game
email: werewolves@cs.unm.edu
website: werewolves.cs.unm.edu

Virtual Werewolves is a Linux based, multiplayer game designed to teach Cybersecurity. Players must exploit inference channels in the Linux kernel to identify other's identities and conceal their own.

You should just need to run...

sudo ./install.sh

...to get it installed.

Update patch using Asynchronous I/O

Clone this github repo https://github.com/miltiades-the-general/distributed-werewolves-redesign on a linux machine or virtual machine.

To play, run ./install.sh and wait for the game to download. The downloader with be prompted to create a password for the moderator. Ensure that you save this password. 

In order for the game to work, at least 3 players must ssh into the host machine.
One player must ssh as the moderator using ```$ssh moderator@ip-address```, 
and two players must ssh using ```$ssh playerX@ip-address```. Valid players range from 1 to 15.

Once all players have ssh'd into the host machine the moderator runs the game ```$python3 server.py```,
and subsequently the players run ```$python3 client.py```, on their respective machines.

As opposed to the previous version of Werewolves, this version does not use multithreading in the group chat thread and instead relies on a central signalHandler thread to monitor and handle I/O throughout the game. 


How is our approach different?

In the previous version of werewolves connections and group chat were handled using multithreading.

In our version, we removed the use of multithreading for handling connections and the group chat.
